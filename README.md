# Where's my matey???

"Where's my matey???" is a quick and fun game where the user plays as a parrot collecting fruit in the desert.

The player is an escaped parrot who fled the clutches of Captain Redbeard and is now gathering fruit in the desert to survive,
but watch out for those pesky pirates trying to nab you!

Players use the WASD keys to move their parrot to collect fruit and avoid pirates.
The background is a desert with 2D pixelated characters. There is also background music and sound/particle effects.

The main joy of this game was the sound effects. The struggle was only having one working computer.

Zoie's computer broke during this lab so her and Rhett worked together to create the game, mainly Zoie did things she was able to do on the computer such as editing some scripts, finding the game art and sounds, and helping troubleshoot along the way. Rhett did most of the initializing and all of the work on the unity side of things.
